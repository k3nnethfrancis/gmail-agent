## Context

You are continuing work on a **Calendar Assistant + Inbox Concierge** application. The core classification system and major functionality has been **successfully implemented** in the previous session:

‚úÖ **Completed Major Features:**
- Manual tag editing (click tags to edit them)
- Training examples system (mark emails as examples)  
- Enhanced classification engine (uses training examples + smart rules)
- Database reset functionality
- Chat state persistence (Zustand)
- Interactive email widget
- Empty category filtering
- Category sorting by email count

However, **user testing revealed several UI/UX polish issues** that need attention.

## Your Mission

Fix remaining UI polish issues and improve the overall user experience. Focus on visual consistency, layout problems, and usability improvements.

## Essential Reading (Start Here)

1. **Read first**: `/docs/ISSUES.md` - Contains all issues including latest UI problems
2. **Architecture context**: `/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design and component structure  
3. **Current features**: `/docs/FEATURES.md` - What currently works
4. **Code quality standards**: `/docs/ENGINEERING.md` - Development patterns

## üîß Critical UI Issues to Fix

Based on user screenshot feedback, the following issues are visible:

### Issue #9: Inbox Categories Text Truncation (HIGH - 1 hour)
**Status**: üü° Ready for Implementation  
**Problem**: Category names are cut off/truncated in the left sidebar  
**Evidence**: Screenshot shows "General" and "System Notifications" text partially visible  
**Location**: `src/components/InboxView.tsx` (category sidebar)

**Solution**:
1. Adjust sidebar width or text wrapping
2. Add tooltips for truncated category names
3. Ensure category names are fully readable

### Issue #10: Email Count Display Issues (HIGH - 1 hour)  
**Status**: üü° Ready for Implementation  
**Problem**: Email counts may not be displaying correctly next to categories  
**Evidence**: Screenshot shows categories but email counts aren't clearly visible  
**Location**: `src/components/InboxView.tsx` (category display)

**Solution**:
1. Verify email count calculation logic
2. Improve count display styling/positioning
3. Ensure counts match actual email numbers

### Issue #11: Input Field Focus/Layout Issues (MEDIUM - 1 hour)
**Status**: üü° Ready for Implementation  
**Problem**: "Type category name..." input field appears to be floating/misaligned  
**Evidence**: Screenshot shows input field in unexpected position  
**Location**: `src/components/InboxView.tsx` (inline editing)

**Solution**:
1. Fix input field positioning and styling
2. Improve inline editing UX
3. Ensure proper focus management

### Issue #12: New2 Category Styling (MEDIUM - 30 min)
**Status**: üü° Ready for Implementation  
**Problem**: The "New2" tag appears with default/poor styling  
**Evidence**: Screenshot shows basic blue tag without proper design  
**Location**: `src/components/InboxView.tsx` (tag display)

**Solution**:
1. Improve tag styling consistency
2. Ensure tag colors are visually appealing
3. Fix tag spacing and alignment

## üéØ Secondary Improvements (If Time Permits)

### Issue #13: Email List Layout Polish (LOW - 1 hour)
**Problem**: Email list items could benefit from better spacing and visual hierarchy  
**Solution**: Improve padding, typography, and visual separation between emails

### Issue #14: Responsive Design Check (LOW - 30 min)  
**Problem**: Ensure mobile/tablet layouts work properly  
**Solution**: Test responsive breakpoints and adjust if needed

## Implementation Priority

**Recommended Order**:
1. **Issue #9** - Text truncation (affects usability)
2. **Issue #10** - Email count display (data accuracy)  
3. **Issue #11** - Input field positioning (UX clarity)
4. **Issue #12** - Tag styling (visual polish)

## Code Quality Requirements

- ‚úÖ **Visual Consistency**: All UI elements should follow design system
- ‚úÖ **Text Readability**: No truncated text without tooltips
- ‚úÖ **Data Accuracy**: Email counts must match reality
- ‚úÖ **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, mobile
- ‚úÖ **Accessibility**: Proper focus management and keyboard navigation

## Current System Status

**‚úÖ What's Working Well**:
- All 200 emails are classified into meaningful categories
- Manual tag editing works (click tags to edit)
- Training examples system functional  
- Chat history persists across view switches
- Email widget shows accurate data
- Categories sorted by email count
- Empty categories properly hidden

**‚ùå What Needs Polish**:
- Category text truncation in sidebar
- Email count display consistency
- Input field positioning/styling
- Tag visual design improvements
- General layout polish

## Development Environment

```bash
# The app is already running
npm run dev  # Server on localhost:3000

# Core systems are functional
# Authentication is working  
# Database has 200 classified emails
# All major features implemented
```

## Success Criteria

When complete:
- ‚úÖ All category names are fully readable (no truncation)
- ‚úÖ Email counts display correctly and consistently
- ‚úÖ Inline editing feels natural and well-positioned
- ‚úÖ All tags have consistent, appealing visual styling
- ‚úÖ Overall interface feels polished and professional

## Key Files You'll Be Working With

- `src/components/InboxView.tsx` - Main inbox interface (most UI issues here)
- `src/components/widgets/EmailWidget.tsx` - Right-dock widget styling
- `src/components/LeftRail.tsx` - Left sidebar layout
- Global CSS files for styling consistency

## Important Notes

- **This is polish work** - don't break existing functionality
- **Focus on visual improvements** - the data layer is working correctly
- **Test responsive design** - ensure mobile/tablet experience is good
- **Use consistent styling** - follow existing design patterns
- **The classification system works perfectly** - just UI needs polish

## Context from Previous Sessions

**Previous Work Done**:
- Fixed 8 major functional issues (classification, training, etc.)
- Implemented sophisticated email classification with training examples
- Added manual tag editing and training example marking
- Created database reset and organic classification system
- Fixed chat persistence and widget interactivity
- Implemented category filtering and sorting

**Current State**: The application is **fully functional** with excellent data processing and user workflows. This session focuses purely on **UI/UX polish** to make the interface as professional and usable as the underlying functionality.

## Getting Started

1. **Examine the current UI** - Load the inbox view and identify layout issues
2. **Fix text truncation** - Start with category sidebar readability  
3. **Verify email counts** - Ensure data accuracy in displays
4. **Polish inline editing** - Improve input field positioning and styling
5. **Use the TodoWrite tool** to track progress

The system has excellent functionality - you're polishing the interface to match the quality of the underlying AI-powered email management system!
