# Strategy Question**

Most of the value in the internet boom has been generated by people finding novel ways to apply this new technology to existing problems. Sometimes that was in the context of existing businesses, and many times it was new businesses. The internet itself didn’t change that much.

AI is on a similar trend.

If you agree with me, choose an existing product that you think could benefit from a strong AI integration. Describe that AI integration and why it would be valuable. This integration should highlight novel approaches to using AI.

If you disagree with me, convince me why I’m wrong.

Mostly agree, but introducing technology creates problems of its own, which are often solved by more technology, ironically. Cloud is good example of this. Because of computers that were both memory constrained and limited in terms of shareability, virtual solutions came about to solve this problem. The problem itself didn't exist before computers.

In my view, AI is more analogous to computers than the cloud, which is why I agree with this overall. AI allows us to solve problems that always existed, but in a new way thanks to what it can do. This is largely because a primary AI use case is the automation of human labor. Humans solving these problems already, and now AI is helping them do it smarter and faster. That said, AI also creates problems of its own. Such as the need for context, which is why vector databases got so popular.

An existing product that would benefit from a strong AI integration would be file sharing systems. Today, many file sharing systems are made for scale or not designed for AI native workflows. Take Google docs for example, which is not accompanied by a RAG system or vector storage of any kind. In the past, this was fine for many use cases. And when you needed more you upgraded to something like DropBox or NextCloud. The problem with these systems in the AI era is that they are based on object storage. In order to build AI integrations effectively, one would have to build an API layer on top of this object storage system. Desiging read/write privledges, possibly as MCPs. But what if I could just spin up a VM, give everyone access to a shared folder connected to it, and deploy claude code in that system? Through the terminal, claude could do everything out-of-the-box that you would have to build on top of object storage systems-reading, writing, creation, deletion. It could even do things autonomously for you in the background. A massive drop in complexity with the maximum benefits gained from the bitter lesson.
