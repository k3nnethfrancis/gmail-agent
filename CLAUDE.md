## Project Context

This application demonstrates enterprise-level AI integration with real-world APIs. The goal is to provide a natural language interface for calendar and email management that actually works with users' real Google accounts.

The system has evolved from a complex, fragmented codebase into a clean, modular application with a unified interface and working classification pipeline.
